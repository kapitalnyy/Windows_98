                            <p>How to play?</p>
                            <p >Objective:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Your goal is to uncover all the squares on the board that do not contain mines.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Use flags to mark potential mines and avoid clicking on them.</p>

                            <p >Rules:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- The board consists of hidden squares, some of which contain mines.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Left-click on a square to reveal it:</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - If the square contains a mine, the game is over.</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - If the square does not contain a mine, it will show a number or remain blank:</p>
                            <p class="p1">    - A number indicates how many mines are in the surrounding 8 squares.</p>
                            <p class="p1">    - A blank square (0 nearby mines) will automatically reveal its neighboring squares.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Right-click on a square to place a flag[F]. Flags help you mark squares you believe contain mines.</p>

                            <p >How to Play:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Starting the Game:</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - Click any square to begin. The first square is guaranteed to be safe.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Analyzing Clues:</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - Numbers on revealed squares provide hints about the locations of nearby mines.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Placing Flags:</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - If you're confident a square contains a mine, right-click it to place a flag. Flags can be toggled on and off.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Continuing:</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - Keep uncovering squares and marking mines with flags until all safe squares are revealed.</p>

                            <p >Winning the Game:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- You win when all non-mine squares are revealed.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Flags are helpful but not mandatory for winning.</p>

                            <p >Losing the Game:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- The game ends immediately if you left-click on a square with a mine.</p>

                            <p >Tips and Strategies:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Use numbers to deduce mine locations:</p>
                            <p class="p1">  - For example, if a revealed square shows "1" and is adjacent to only one hidden square, that square must contain a mine.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Avoid guessing whenever possible. Use logic to determine safe squares and mine locations.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Be cautious: avoid rushing to click if you're uncertain about a square.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Early in the game, guessing might be unavoidable, but as the board clears, logic takes over.</p>

                            <p >Controls:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Left-click: Reveal a square.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Right-click: Place or remove a flag.</p>
                            <p class="p1">- Use these controls to alternate between marking potential mines and uncovering safe squares.</p>

                            <p >Resetting the Game:</p>
                            <p class="p1">- The game will automatically reset if you lose, or you can refresh the page to start a new game.</p>
